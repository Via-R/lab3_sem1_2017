# Voronoi diagram
This labwork implements the process of building of the Voronoi diagram using predefined points
## How to test
In order to test the labwork, you need MS Visual Studio C++ installed, then clone the repository using

    > git clone https://github.com/Via-R/lab3_sem1_2017.git

Then open the .sln file with MS Visual Studio and launch the project. You also need to choose `Win32` platform to successfully build the project.
Once you launch the compiled project, you will see the Voronoi diagram that was built using the points defined in `input.txt` file. If you want to build your own diagram, just edit the `input.txt` file with you own points (they should be in [-50, 50] x [-50, 50] space).
